I am a software developer with 25 years of software development experience. I am very familiar with JavaScript, Node.js and ECMA Script. I am most comfortable working with JavaScript, but I also have experience with other technologies like Java, Postgres, MySQL and Marklogic. I write and use shell scripts all the time to find files, perform string replacements and automate activities and tasks. My favorite and most comfortable IDE is MacVim, but I also use VSCode, Cursor and IntelliJ.

I enjoy parsing through data. I do this frequently using XQuery and XPath. I also do this using CSS selectors to manipulate HTML DOM. I enjoy creating Chrome extensions. I often use curl calls in the terminal to help understand how endpoints work.

I love using Mac computers because they are reliable and I'm not interested in spending time to tweak the configuration. I just want things to work and allow me to write my software.

Please take into account my profile as you share ideas so that we both have a more common base of knowledge to work from.
